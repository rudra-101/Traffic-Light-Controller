# Traffic-Light-Controller

The above project is a Verilog implementation of a traffic light controller.
It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to control the sequence of traffic light signals.
The FSM transitions through different states based on a clock signal and generates appropriate outputs for the traffic lights. 
The simulation waveform displays the count and current state (ps) values, along with the signal waveforms, providing a visual representation of the traffic light controller's behavior.
